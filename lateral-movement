## Steal access tokens
#### Google
-  Google JSON Tokens and credentials.db
-  JSON tokens typically used for service account access to GCP
-  If a user authenticates with gcloud from an instance their creds get stored here ```~/.config/gcloud/credentials.db```
```
sudo find /home -name "credentials.db
"
```

#### Azure: Visual Studio Code
- Azure Cloud Service Packages (.cspkg)
- Deployment files created by Visual Studio.
- Possible other Azure services integration (SQL, storage, etc.)
- Look through cspkg zip files for creds/certs.
- Search Visual Studio Public Directory ```<cloud project directory>\bin\debug\publish```

#### Azure: Publish settings in files
- Look for file ```.publishsettings```
- Can contain a Base64 encoded Management Certificate or cleartext credentials
- Save "ManagementCertificate" section into a new .pfx file
- Search the user's Downloads directory and VS projects.

#### Azure: Storage explorers
- Windows Credential Manager stores these credentials.
- Azure Storage Explorer for example has a built-in “Developer Tools” function that you can use to set breakpoints while loading the credentials allowing you to view them while unencrypted.

#### Web config and App config files
-  ```Web.config``` and ```app.config``` files might contain creds or access tokens.
- Look for management cert and extract to ```.pfx``` like publishsettings files

#### Internal repositories
- Find internal repos (scan for port 80, 443 or Query AD and look for subdomains or hostnames as git, code, repo, gitlab, bitbucket etc)
